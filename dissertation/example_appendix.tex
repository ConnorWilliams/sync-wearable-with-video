\chapter{An Example Appendix}
\label{appx:example}

Content which is not central to, but may enhance the dissertation can be
included in one or more appendices; examples include, but are not limited
to

\begin{itemize}
\item lengthy mathematical proofs, numerical or graphical results which
      are summarised in the main body,
\item sample or example calculations,
      and
\item results of user studies or questionnaires.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that in line with most research conferences, the marking panel is not
obliged to read such appendices.
