\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}
% A compulsory section, of at most 1 page
%
% A detailed summary, in bullet point form, of any third-party resources,
% hardware and software components, used during the project.
% The goal of this section is simply to be clear about how and where they are
% used, so that a clear assessment of your work can result. eg:
%     * I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation
%         of RSA.
%     * I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture
%         images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g.,
%         threshold, edge detection).
%     * I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it
%         to support an open-source UART core obtained from http://opencores.org/.
%     * The web-interface component of my system was implemented by
%         extending the open-source WordPress software available from
%         http://wordpress.org/.

\begin{itemize}
\item Python for implementation.
\item SciPy: Numpy, Matplotlib.... for help.
\end{itemize}
