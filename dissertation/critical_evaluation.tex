\chapter{Critical Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
% A topic-specific chapter, of roughly 15 pages
%
% Evaluate what you did. Highly topic-specific, but for many projects will have flavours of the following:
%     * Functional testing, including analysis and explanation of failure cases.
%     * Behavioural testing, often including analysis of any results that draw some form of conclusion wrt. the aims and objectives.
%     * Evaluation of options and decisions within the project, and/or a comparison with alternatives.
%
% This chapter often differentiates project quality. Even if the work completed is of a high technical quality, critical yet objective evaluation and comparison of the outcomes is crucial.
%
% The reader wants to learn something, so the worst examples amount to simple statements of fact e.g.'graph X shows the result is Y'. The best examples are analytical and exploratory e.g.'graph X shows the result is Y, which means Z; this contradicts Z1, which may be because I use a different assumption'. As such, both positive and negative outcomes are valid if presented in a suitable manner.
