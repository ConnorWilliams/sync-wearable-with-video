\section{Synchronising two device clocks}
One way to interpret the problem at hand would be to treat it as an issue of finding a ground truth time when two clocks are running out of synchronisation from each other.

In a system where all of the sensors were connected to a central device the solution is trivial; the centralized device will dictate the system time. Cristian's algorithm and the Berkeley Algorithm, described below, are some solutions to the clock synchronization problem in a centralized server environment.

In a distributed system, such as the one we have, the problem takes on more complexity because a global time is not easily known. The most used clock synchronization solution on the Internet is the Network Time Protocol (NTP) which is a layered client-server architecture based on UDP message passing.

\subsection{Cristian's algorithm}
Cristian's algorithm relies on the existence of a time server. The time server maintains its clock by using a radio clock or other accurate time source, then all other computers in the system stay synchronized with it. A time client will maintain its clock by making a procedure call to the time server. Variations of this algorithm make more precise time calculations by factoring in network radio propagation time.

\subsection{Berkeley algorithm}
The Berkeley algorithm is suitable for systems where a radio clock is not present, this system has no way of making sure of the actual time other than by maintaining a global average time as the global time. A time server will periodically fetch the time from all the time clients, average the results, and then report back to the clients the adjustment that needs be made to their local clocks to achieve the average. This algorithm highlights the fact that internal clocks may vary not only in the time they contain but also in the clock rate.

Often, any client whose clock differs by a value outside of a given tolerance is disregarded when averaging the results. This prevents the overall system time from being drastically skewed due to one erroneous clock.

\subsection{Network Time Protocol}
Network Time Protocol a class of mutual network synchronization protocol that allows for use-selectable policy control in the design of the time synchronization and evidence model. NTP supports single inline and meshed operating models in which a clearly defined master source of time is used ones in which no penultimate master or reference clocks are needed.

In NTP service topologies based on peering, all clocks equally participate in the synchronization of the network by exchanging their timestamps using regular beacon packets. In addition NTP supports a unicast type time transfer which provides a higher level of security. NTP performance is tunable based on its application and environmental loading as well. NTP combines a number of algorithms to robustly select and compare clocks, together with a combination of linear and decision-based control loop feedback models that allows multiple time synchronization probes to be combined over long time periods to produce high quality timing and clock drift estimates. Because NTP allows arbitrary synchronization mesh topologies, and can withstand (up to a point) both the loss of connectivity to other nodes, and \"falsetickers\" that do not give consistent time, it is also robust against failure and misconfiguration of other nodes in the synchronization mesh.

NTP is highly robust, widely deployed throughout the Internet, and well tested over the years, and is generally regarded as the state of the art in distributed time synchronization protocols for unreliable networks. It can reduce synchronization
offsets to times of the order of a few milliseconds over the public Internet, and to sub-millisecond levels over local area networks.

A simplified version of the NTP protocol, SNTP, can also be used as a pure single-shot stateless master-slave synchronization protocol, but lacks the sophisticated features of NTP, and thus has much lower performance and reliability levels. \cite{wikipedia_clock_synchronisation}

There are also other clock synchronisation methods over connected devices such as Clock Sampling Mutual Network Synchronization, Precision Time Protocol, Synchronous Ethernet, Reference Broadcast Synchronization and even Global Positioning System.

\section{Synchronise two 1-dimensional signals along the time axis}
The way which I have found a solution to this problem is by synchronising the data after it has been collected. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can derive acceleration from position.
    \item Show derived acceleration from video data is highly correlated with accelerometer data when time is not drifted. This justifies this way is the right way.
    \item Example with simple data.
    \item How does one track a drift?
    \item What does 'drift' even mean?
    \item Dynamic Time Warping - why won't it work?
    \item Cross correlation - why won't it work?
    \item Sliding window cross correlation - how might it work?
    \item Periodic data - how do we avoid cyclic maximums of cross correlation?
\end{itemize}
