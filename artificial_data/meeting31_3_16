Cross correlation between -1 and 1

What temporal distortions am I considering?
    * No distortion
    * One clock runs slower than the other
    * Jumps
    * Sudden resynchronizations

What is the problem
Temporal distortions
Data Generator and why i've added certain features
Methods for fixing synthetic data - what works and what doesnt
